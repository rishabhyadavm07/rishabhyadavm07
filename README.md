# ðŸ’« About Me:

- ðŸŽ“ **Infosec Student**: Currently diving deep into the world of cybersecurity, with a focus on finding and defending against vulnerabilities.
- ðŸ§© **CTF Aficionado**: When I'm not hunting for real vulnerabilities, I'm solving puzzles for fun (yes, it's a lifestyle).
- ðŸŒ² **Hiking Fan**: I tackle trails IRL the way I tackle codeâ€”one obstacle at a time. And yes, mountains can be as challenging as firewalls.
